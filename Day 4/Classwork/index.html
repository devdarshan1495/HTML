        <h2 id="MI">Main Information</h2>

        <p> Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, often called "man's best friend." They’ve been living alongside humans for thousands of years and have been bred into hundreds of different breeds with various shapes, sizes, and personalities.</p> <br>
        <h2 id="desc">Description</h2>
        <p>Dogs are descendants of wolves, and their domestication is believed to have started at least 15,000 to 30,000 years ago. Early humans and wolves probably formed a mutually beneficial relationship: wolves got food scraps, and humans got protection and hunting help.

            Through selective breeding over centuries, humans shaped wolves into today’s domestic dogs — everything from tiny Chihuahuas to giant Great Danes.</p> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h2 id="temp">Temperament</h2>
        <p>Dogs are incredibly diverse, but generally:

            They’re loyal, affectionate, and eager to please.
            
            Many breeds are social and love being around people or other dogs.
            
            Temperament can vary a lot by breed:
            
            Retrievers are friendly and playful.
            
            Border Collies are super smart and energetic.
            
            Bulldogs are chill and cuddly.
            
            Training and environment also play a big role in shaping a dog’s behavior.
