  <h1>Welcome to My Practice Webpage</h1>
  <p>I’m someone who values purpose and clarity in everything I do. Whether I’m learning, working, or navigating through challenges, I strive to stay intentional and focused. I believe in quiet strength—the kind that shows up consistently, even when no one’s watching. Growth, to me, is a daily commitment: asking better questions, being open to feedback, and choosing progress over perfection. I’m not trying to do everything, just the right things, deeply and well.

  </p>
  <div>
    <p>I’m someone who finds joy in the little details—whether it's tweaking a design, organizing thoughts into code, or simply appreciating a good sunset. I love learning new things and turning ideas into something real, whether it’s a cool project, a thoughtful solution, or a fresh perspective. I believe in staying curious, working with intention, and always leaving room for a bit of fun along the way.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <p>I’m equal parts laid-back and driven. I like working at my own pace, but when I set my mind to something, I give it my all. Whether I’m solving problems, exploring new tech, or just vibing to music while thinking through an idea, I try to stay grounded, focused, and open to whatever comes next. Growth, to me, isn’t about pressure—it’s about progress, mindset, and enjoying the ride.”
