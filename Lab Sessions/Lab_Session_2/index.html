        <h2>About David Goggins</h2>
        <p>
          David Goggins is a former Navy SEAL, Air Force Tactical Air Controller, and Army Ranger School graduate. But his story didn’t start there. He overcame poverty, racism, learning disabilities, and childhood trauma to become a living symbol of mental toughness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, he’s an ultramarathon runner, endurance athlete, motivational speaker, and bestselling author. His message is simple but powerful: Get comfortable being uncomfortable. Callous your mind. Stay hard.
